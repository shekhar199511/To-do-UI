# To-do-UI

A React JS App to maintain list of tasks. Run npm install on the project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## To do for this to-do app (cause todo needs several todo's to reach final form)
* Routing
* A modal that opens up an advanced form for an advanced task with time and date
